HISTORY.DOC - This file documents all of the changes and improvements we have
made to QuickPak Professional beginning with version 4.00.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEARCH.ASM (BASIC 7 only)   4-25-91
Fixed a bug in the single precision compare routine that popped SI and DI
in the wrong order.

FINDEXCT.ASM (BASIC 7 only) 5-15-91
Added Push ES/Pop ES (2 places) around STRINGLENGTH and STRINGADDRESS calls.

FARSTR.ASM (BASIC 7 only)   5-17-91
Removed unnecessary code, added code to prevent creating a zero-length
string, and fixed some comment typos.

FILECOPY.BAS                5-26-91
Added code to prevent copying files on top of themselves.

KEYDOWN.ASM                 5-27-91
New routine reports if a key is currently being pressed.

INCOUNT2.ASM (PDS only)     5-29-91
Fixed a problem when the two string arguments were in different segments.

PARSESTR.ASM                6-2-91
New ParseString routine parses strings using a table of delimiters.

DIALOG.BAS                  6/3/91
Added the new assembler routine KeyDown to cause Dialog to wait until the
terminating key that was pressed is released.  All of the demo programs
(DEMODIAL.BAS, DEMODIA2.BAS, and DEMODIAP.BAS) have new comments about this.

QINSTRH.ASM                 6-17-91
New routine finds any string anywhere in memory.

SPLITNAM.ASM                6-20-91
New routine splits a file name into its component parts.

LOADEXEC.ASM (and .BAS)     6-21-91
New routine allows shelling to another program and getting its exit code.

REPLCTBL.ASM                6-27-91
New routines replaces characters using a translation table.

SRCHPATH.BAS                6-27-91
New function searchs all directories listed in PATH= for a file.

AMENU.ASM (near and far strings)    6-28-91
Fixed the bug caused when BASIC moves the array and AMenu is being used in
the polling mode (ScanCode = 3).

FILEVIEW.ASM (and FILEVIEW.BAS)     6-28-91
New feature performs Tab expansion with user-specified number of spaces/Tab.

Just prior to releasing version 4.00, a major reorganization was made to the
assembly language source files.  In previous versions there was an enormous
amount of duplication, because only minor changes to many original QuickBASIC
files were needed to make them work with BASIC 7.  The only routines that
needed major changes are those that accept or return strings.  In all other
cases, the changes were simply to preserve the ES, SI, and DI registers if
they were used.  In this version of QuickPak Professional only those routines
that handle strings are kept separate, and the remaining routines will work
with either QuickBASIC or BASIC 7 PDS.

GETCMOS.BAS                 7-2-91
New demo program shows how to read information in AT-compatible CMOS RAM.

INTCTRL.ASM                 7-2-91
New QPCli and QPSti routines to disable and reenable interrupts.

NETDRIVE.ASM                7-10-91
New routine tells if a given drive is remote (on a network).

REMOVABL.ASM                7-10-91
New routine tells if a given drive's media is removable (a floppy drive).

    ^-------------------------------- 4.00 ------------------------------^

SRCHPATH.BAS                7-18-91
Ooops!  Changed the search order to .COM and then .EXE and then .BAT.

MSGBOX.BAS                  7-29-91
Deleted an unnecessary extra test for Message$ being null.

REPLCTBL.ASM (QB and BC7)   7-29-91
Added an extra Dec BP to account for the table being *pairs* of characters.

PARSESTR.ASM (BASIC 7 only) 7-29-91
Changed the incorrect procedure name from ParseStr to ParseString (oops).

GETVMODE.ASM                8-5-91
Removed unnecessary code that looks for a mono monitor and also causes the
routine to not recognize an EGA/VGA mono properly.

PARSESTR.ASM                8-6-91
Remmed out the code that eats leading spaces and Tabs at Don's request.  Then
added more remmed out code showing how to eat CHR$(0) bytes if needed.

MASCIIPK.ASM and MCOLORPK.ASM   8-9-91
Added a call to ShowCursor in the code block at Next_Row.  Consolidated the
BASIC PDS version of MASCIIPK into the QB version since they're the same.

FILEVIEW.ASM                8-12-91
Fixed a bug where seeking to a loc in the file > 64K away didn't always work.

REPLACET.ASM and REPLACT2.ASM   8-13-91
TYPE variable versions of the ReplaceChar and ReplaceChar2 routines.

DIALOG.BAS                  8-15-91
Added Found = 0 to fix a bug that sometimes located the cursor incorrectly on
an option button.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.01 ------------------------------^

FNSPREAD.BAS                8-19-91
Fixed a bug in QPACOS when X# <> 1.  The formula in the manual was correct.

MAX?.ASM and MIN?.ASM       9-5-91
Fixed a bug in the Currency and floating Min/Max functions that crashed when
only one element was given.

GRAFCURS.BAS                9-28-91
New example program shows how to define custom mouse cursor shapes.

QPSOLVER.BAS                10-6-91
Added "=" to the table of delimiters recognized in the Var2Value$ function,
so expressions such as "X=100" can be watched.

SPLITNAM.ASM                10-14-91
Added code to detect a trailing backslash (no file name) and return a null
string for FileName$ in that case.

FNSPREAD.BAS                10-15-91
QPROUND$ has been made nearly 7 times faster (when no coprocessor is present)
using a simple improvement that is shown in the source code.

SCANFILE.BAS                10-30-91
Nash fixed an obscure bug that caused the program to sit in an endless loop
if the string being searched for is all that is in the file.

SCROLLIN.BAS                11-15-91
Modified mouse code to correctly test for mouse clicks to the left and right
of the text field when the mouse is clicked outside of the field.  Changed
use of InstrTbl2 to QInstr2 because the table feature wasn't really needed.

FINDT*.ASM                  11-23-91
Added code upon entry to check for a segment boundary to trap a very obscure
and occasional problem.  Similar code was added to all four routines.

DOSERROR.ASM                11-27-91
Fixed a bug where the wrong register was checked for the file's attribute.

WINDOW.ASM and WINDOW.BAS   12-2-91
Complete set of window management routines and example program.

MIDCHAR.ASM and MIDCHARS.ASM    12-2-91
New routines allow reading or assigning a single character very quickly.

SHRTHERE.ASM                12-11-91
New routine reports if SHARE is installed.

PICKLIST.BAS                12/6/91
Modified PICKLIST.BAS to return items in the Picked() array in the order
selected as is described in the manual.  Previous versions returned selected
items in sorted order.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.02 ------------------------------^

FARSTR.ASM                  1-4-92
Reassembled the source code and rebuilt PRO7.LIB and PRO7.QLB.  A while back
Jay tightened the code, but the new version had never been assembled.

EXENAME.ASM (QB and PDS)    1-5-92
Modified to use a local buffer for the output instead of the QPDTA to allow
longer output names.

R$GDT.ASM and R$FORMAT.ASM (and FORMAT.BAS demo)  1-7-91
New routines to return the type of floppy drive and format a floppy drive.

GETCPU.ASM                  1-10-92
Added support for recognizing an 80486 processor.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.03 ------------------------------^

PULLDNMS.BAS                7-15-91
Fixed the COMMAND$ code that caused "String formula to complex" error when
BASIC used up all its temporary string discriptors after repeatedly running
the program.  (This is a BASIC PDS bug we worked around, not our bug.)

QEDITS.BAS                  9-12-91
Fixed a problem where nothing could be entered on the last line of the array
if it was full.  This behavior was correct when in insert mode, but not when
overtyping.  Also moved some mouse handling code around to better accommodate
Quick Screen.

VERTMENU.BAS                1-8-92
Made a change to allow typing letters to find drives in QD.BAS such as [-A-].

MAKEQLB.BAS                 1-14-92
Fixed problem where function references that included an equal sign but no
spaces between caused MAKEQLB to ignore the reference.  ie: FuncName=SomeVar

HAND2NAM.ASM/HAND2NAM.BAS   1-29-92
New routine returns a file's name and extension given a DOS file handle.

QEDIT7.BAS                  2-4-92
Same as QEDIT*.BAS changes above, but also handles Ctrl-Ins keys (BASIC 7
only).  Fixed some problems with the delete key behavior.

QEDIT.BAS                   2-18-92
Fixed some problems with word wrap where paragraphs were not formed upward
properly.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.10 ------------------------------^
SRCHPATH.BAS                3-4-92
Fixed the problem where ParseString$ was misnamed.

VERTMENU.BAS                4-22-92
Fixed a bug preventing a one-letter "hot key" from getting to the last item.

MASKIN.BAS                  4-25-92
Added support for foreign language characters.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.11 ------------------------------^

CODE2NUM.ASM                5-6-92
Fixed the bug that failed when working with Currency data.  This fix affects
all of the SortT and ISortT routines, and also KeySort.

EVALUATE.BAS                5-9-92
Fixed a bug that crashed when using ARCSIN with certain values.

COMPCY.ASM                  5-10-92
Complete rewrite for greatly improved efficiency.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.12 ------------------------------^

SCIFORM.BAS                 6-16-92
New demo/routines program formats numbers in scientific notation.

DEMOXMS.BAS                 6-21-92
XMSInfoType was incorrect.

XMSINFO.ASM                 6-21-92
When no UMBs are available, DX doesn't contain a valid number. We check for
an error code and if no UMBs are available, we now return zero.

XMSMAIN.ASM                 6-21-92
C$DeallocXMS now calls C$DelHandle to remove a deallocated XMS handle from
our handle array.

DECLARE.BAS                 6-21-92
XMSAllocMem was incorrectly declared.  Added BYVAL for NumK% parameter.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.13 ------------------------------^

CLOCK.ASM and CLOCK24.ASM   7-30-92
Changed the code to chain to the original Int 1Ch rather than return to the
caller.  This lets these routines now work in the BASIC editors.

Removed NEARSTR.ASM and NEARSTR.OBJ from the response files that build the
product because they were never actually used or documented.

Built and added PROVBD.QLB to allow QuickPak to work with Visual Basic for
DOS (VB-DOS).

Added README.VBD to explain the small differences needed to use QuickPak
with VB-DOS.

Modified some BASIC files to rename variables that are now reserved words in
VB-DOS.  See README.VBD for details.

KEYDOWN.ASM                 9-9-92
Changed the code to use B_ONEXIT instead of _ONEXIT to support VB-DOS.  This
change now makes this routine incompatible with QuickBASIC 4.0 (4.0 only).

    ^-------------------------------- 4.14 ------------------------------^

R$FORMAT.ASM                9-25-92
Fixed the problem where any error was reported as "Track zero bad".

CLOCK.ASM and CLOCK24.ASM   10-4-92
Added code to periodically refresh the clock, to prevent it from losing time.

Reorganized the way the entire product is set up on the distribution disks;
created a new INSTALL program that support multiple destination directories.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.15 ------------------------------^

QPUSI.ASM                   10-15-92
REMmed out the incoming variable in the Proc declaration to fix a bug.

R$GDT.ASM                   10-26-92
Allen Hillman added code to recognize 2.88MB drives.  Thanks to Allen!

SPLITNAM.ASM                11-20-92
Added code to handle an incoming null string for the full name being split.

DEMOGAS.BAS and GASGAUGE.BAS    11-28-92
New demo and subprogram, provides an attractive progress/status indicator.

WINDOW.ASM                  12-18-92
Added the QPWindowRow and QPWindowCol functions and the QPWindowPrintCR and
QPWindowPrintWrap subroutines.  Added descriptions to the README manual in
the section that describes the other QPWindow routines.

WINDOW.BAS                  12-18-92
Added code to show the new routines mentioned in WINDOW.ASM above.

EDAT2NUM.ASM (far strings)  1-11-93 
Added a call to delete the temporary string created.

FILESORT.BAS                1-12-93
Added explicit lower bounds to REDIM in the FileSort subprogram.

MAKEQLB.BAS                 2-16-93
Bob Simmons added support for VB/DOS programs.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.16 ------------------------------^

QINSTRH.ASM                 3-7-93
Shuffled code around to fix an obscure bug that caused an infinite loop when
the first byte of Search$ matched the last byte specified in NumBytes&.  A
special thanks to Michael H. Shacter for finding this AND providing the fix.

ASSEMBLY.ASM & ASSEMBLY.DOC 3-9-93
Added code that fudges SS:SP to allow SS to be set to the same value as DS,
which is assumed by many of the QuickPak routines (esp. DOS routines).  Then
modified the DOC file to reflect that change.  Thanks to Michael Shacter for
pointing out the need to do this.

QPUSI.ASM                   3-9-93
Fixed another dumb bug.  How can a 4-line routine cause so many problems?

CLOCK24.ASM                 3-11-93
Fixed a bug that failed to wrap the time at midnight.

INSTALL.BAS                 3-21-93
Added code to be sure PKUNZIP was actually copied before trying to delete it.

The following assembly language routines have all been modified to eliminate
a bug that happened when string compaction occurred during their operation:

    QPLTRIM, QPRTRIM, QPTRIM, COMPACT, QPLEFT, QPMID, QPRIGHT, FLINPUT

    ^-------------------------------- 4.17 ------------------------------^

FSTAMP.ASM (far strings version only) 6-12-93
Fixed a bug where DS was loaded from CS:OldDS, yet CS:OldDS had never been
assigned.  CS:OldDS is now assigned at the very beginning of the routine.

FEOF.ASM                    6-15-93
Added the call to Restore_CEH that should have been there all along...

PULLDOWN.BAS                6-29-93
Fixed a bug that allowed selecting an inactive choice if it was the last one
in the menu list.

COMPACT.ASM (far strings only)      7-13-93
Another compaction fix (see 4.17 above).  Thanks yet again to Myrna Traver
Larson for not only reporting the problem but also submitting the fix code.

QEDIT.BAS                           7-26-93
Added a test in the Del key code to not reference the next higher line if
that line is beyond the end of the array.

QPLEFT.ASM, QPMID.ASM, QPRIGHT.ASM  7-31-93
Fixed the bug added in 4.17 above that failed to test for illegal values when
passing the arguments on to BASIC's LEFT$, MID$, and RIGHT$ routines.

QPLEFT.ASM, QPMID.ASM, QPRIGHT.ASM, QPTRIM.ASM  8-19-93
Added extra code (that shouldn't be necessary) to reassign the output to a
static descriptor before returning.  This fixes a problem that happens in the
QBX editor only.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.18 ------------------------------^

READFILI.ASM (near and far strings versions)    9-22-93
Paul added code to not crash when a file larger than 99MB is encountered.

COMPCY.ASM                          10-16-93
Changed the code in two places from Jne Exit to Jne Done to fixe a subtle bug
that affected signed comparisons.  Also made the same change to the internal
Compare_CY routines in SortT, SortT2, ISortT, and ISortT2.

QEDIT7.BAS                          7-26-93
Same "delete handling" patch as for QEDIT.BAS in 4.18 above.

KEYSORT.BAS                         12-3-93
Changed the SPC(..) functions within the printing loop to instead be "  " to
fix that long-standing, never-fixed SPC/TAB bug in QuickBASIC compiled code.

TEXTSORT.BAS and DEMOTSRT.BAS       1-15-94
New program and demo to sort plain ASCII text files.

QEDITS.BAS                          1-20-94
Various improvements as per Myrna Traver Larson.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.19 ------------------------------^

MRANGE.ASM and MRANGEG.ASM          2-27-94
Added code to clear the incoming Button variable so the caller doesn't have
to do that manually.  Also, merged in the "1" versions of those routines.

READFILI.ASM (far strings version only) 3-29-94
Rewritten nearly from scratch.  The old version required the caller to fill
the array elements with spaces, which were then filled in pieces by ReadFilI
with the file name, date, size, etc.  The problem was QPStrL was used to make
a string version of the file size, which could cause the array elements to
move while they were being assigned.  The rewrite builds the formatted string
in a near-memory buffer, which is then assigned to the array elements.  This
has the additional advantage of not requiring the elements to be pre-padded.

PARSESTR.ASM (far strings version only) 11-4-94
Myrna Larson fixed a problem the occurred when using ParseString with near
strings (it always worked with far strings).

NUM2DATE.ASM and DATE2NUM.ASM (near and far strings) 12-15-1995
Fixed a bug where the year 1900 was wrongly considered a leap year.

FILL1.ASM   12-22-1995
New routine fills bytes of memory.

DIALOG.BAS  12-23-95
Added code to turn off the cursor before the call to MAMenu and then back on
again, to eliminate the cursor which didn't follow the highlight bar.

    ^-------------------------------- 4.20 ------------------------------^
